# transformer-codebase

This is the existing codebase for our transformer model. The structure is based loosely on this repo for [Transformer-XL](https://github.com/kimiyoung/transformer-xl). 

Currently working to get the model to work on the enwik8 dataset.

## Instructions: 
Navigation to the `src` directory and run

```python train.py --cuda```
